# Weight-Tracking-Application

known bugs: 

8) try and get the weeks to show up on the x-axis on the graph page b/c right now all that shows uup are vertical plot points with no time progression 
9) when you initially click on the graph  page nothing shows up, you have to click the history page first

To do: 

5) need to style the pages with more swing or html/css
6) figure out how to make downloadable from Github.



think about using bmi with break calipers AND adding a calorie counter
