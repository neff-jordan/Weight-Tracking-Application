# Weight-Tracking-Application

known bugs: 

1) Clicking each button on the nav bar causes a new frame to appear. need card layout to solve by erasing the frame contents and generating the clicked frames contents 

2) clicking graph multiple times in a row causes duplicate frames

3) need to implement my user class so accounts can be created and data can be used throughout the program. 

4) need to build my linear model for the weight prediction in the home and graph pages. 

5) need to style the pages with more swing or html/css

6) figure out if i can post this to the macOS store.
