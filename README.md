# Weight-Tracking-Application

known bugs: 

1) Clicking each button on the nav bar causes a new frame to appear. need card layout to solve by erasing the frame contents and generating the clicked frames contents
5) need to style the pages with more swing or html/css
6) figure out how to make downloadable from Github. 
7) check the bmi calculator
8) try and get the weeks to show up on the x-axis on the graph page

think about using bmi with break calipers AND adding a calorie counter
